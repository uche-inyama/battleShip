## TEST DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT - TDD [BATTLESHIP]

The purpose of this project, **```battleShip```** is to consolidate a programming paradigm, TDD, that was introduced in Testing practice, which is an introduction to writing tests in JavaScript. Also, other programming concepts learned from previous modules were reinforced. These includes working with:

- [ ] Factory functions.
- [ ] Immediately invoked functions.
- [ ] DOM creation and manipulation.
- [ ] Object oriented Programming.
- [ ] The Module Pattern.
